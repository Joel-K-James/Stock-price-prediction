# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. It utilizes Yahoo Finance to fetch stock data, preprocesses the data, and trains an LSTM model to make future predictions. The results are then visualized to show how the predicted stock prices compare with the actual prices.

## Features
1. Fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
2. Preprocess data using MinMaxScaler for normalization.
3. Use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model to predict stock prices.
4. Visualize the actual vs. predicted stock prices with date labels on the x-axis.
5. Model performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.


## Performance Metrics
1. Mean Squared Error: 28.17090660491397
2. R-squared Score: 0.9196369702475241

## Output
In this project, we used Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data for prediction.The visualization generated shows the actual closing prices of Apple stocks compared to the predicted prices from our LSTM model, demonstrating the model's ability to capture trends in the stock price data.
